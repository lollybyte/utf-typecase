# === Licensecheck ===
# Ignoring python3-xlib because it is only used transitively via pyautogui (BSD-licensed) and mouseinfo (GPLv3).
# The library itself is legacy (GPLv2) and unmaintained, but its usage is wrapped by GPLv3 code,
# making the overall project compatible with GPLv3 under mouseinfo's licensing terms.
# pip show python3-xlib mouseinfo pyautogui
