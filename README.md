# utf-typecase

**utf-typecase** lets you pick Unicode characters from a web interface and type
them on a different machine.

The server shows a customizable grid of symbols. The client checks the server 
periodically, copies the selected character, and simulates keyboard input to 
insert it.

## Installation
```
pip install utf-typecase
```
