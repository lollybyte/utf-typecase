# ðŸ”“ Opening Ports Guide

To allow external access to your server, make sure the designated port is open on the **computer where the server is running**. This involves configuring your systemâ€™s firewall or security settings to accept incoming connections on that port.

For example, if your server is running on port `5000`, ensure that:

- Your local firewall permits traffic on port `5000`
- Your network/router settings donâ€™t block that port
- Youâ€™re aware of security implications when making a port publicly accessible

Opening a port makes the server reachable from other devices â€” but only if it's properly secured.
